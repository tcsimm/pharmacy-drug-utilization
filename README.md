# Analysis of State Drug Utilization Data 2024

This project analyzes the State Drug Utilization Data (2024) published by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) and made available on [Data.gov](https://catalog.data.gov/). The dataset captures **state-level Medicaid prescription data**, including:

- Drug codes (NDC, Labeler, Product, Package)
- Prescription counts
- Reimbursement amounts (total, Medicaid, non-Medicaid)

---

## Project Goals

- Data Cleaning: Handle inconsistencies, missing values, and prepare the dataset for analysis.  
- Exploratory Analysis: Identify prescribing patterns, high-cost drugs, and state-level differences.  
- Visualization: Create clear plots and charts to highlight trends and insights.  
- Insights: Summarize key findings to better understand utilization and cost drivers in Medicaid.

## Tools & Technologies

- Python: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`
- SQLite: Storing and querying cleaned data
- Jupyter Notebooks: For exploration, visualization, and reproducible analysis
